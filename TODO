Function returns:
	☐ A: => File
		if: transformed file already exists, stream it OR redirect to it
		else: create file, stream it OR redirect to it
	☐ B: => Url
		if: transformed file already exists, return Url
		else: create file, return Url

A: 
	PROS:
		☐ Function can be called directly in frontend, as a file src. If we know original name, we can return it transformed any way we like.
		☐ Response can be cached both by browser and CDN (probably)
	CONS:
		☐ Wastefull – calling function for every image render.

B:
	PROS:
		☐ possibly much cheaper – call this function *only* when you want a new resource created.
	CONS:
		☐ really makes sense only if called from the backend

PROBLEMS:
☐  getSignedUrl() is not working. see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50706401/firebase-function-node-js-to-return-download-url-of-image-via-filename-from
